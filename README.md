# Maze-Game
1. Player can run through the maze using input devices.
2. Player is able to collect items on the level so the score level increases.
3. Camera is sticked to the maze level size to see the whole occurrences.
4. If player dies because of beast, then pop-up window appears where final
score is described and retry, and main menu buttons located.
5. Player must collect all items to escape the level.
6. If player is hit by the beast â€“ he/she instantly dies and the life count is decreased, so the game
starts from the beginning, but picked up items are still in the bag.
